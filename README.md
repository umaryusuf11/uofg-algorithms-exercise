Implementing, comparing and defining variants of sorting algorithms in Java.

This exercise has three parts. The first involves implementing four variants of the quicksort algorithm in Java, the second involves running some empirical studies to compare the performance of each version, and the third involves the definition and implementation in Java of an algorithm to compute adversaries for quicksort.
